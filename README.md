# Pokédex

This project use graphql-pokeapi that show Pokemon list and Pokemon details. I'm using `window.localStorage` Web API to persist data on the browser.

### Pokemon List Page

Show a **list of Pokemons’** names and the **o​wned total**.​ When a Pokemon is clicked, it'll redirect you to `Pokemon Detail page`.

### Pokemon Detail Page

Show a picture of th`Pokemon with its moves and types. You can **catch the Pokemon​** with 50% success probability, if success then you can g​ive the Pokemon a nickname​ and add that Pokemon to`My Pokemon List`.

You can catch the same pokemon multiple times but **need to give a​ different nickname​** for each pokemon.

### My Pokemon List Page

Show a list of all P​okemons you have caught.​ You could ​remove/release​ a Pokemon from the list on this page. The pokemons in this list p​ersist​ even after a full page reload.
